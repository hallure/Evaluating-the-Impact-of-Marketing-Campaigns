# 📈 Evaluating the Impact of Marketing Campaigns using A/B Testing & EDA

This project analyzes the effectiveness of a marketing campaign using A/B testing and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to determine whether ad exposure significantly increased conversions compared to a control group that saw a Public Service Announcement (PSA) or nothing.

---

## 🧠 Objective

- Perform hypothesis testing to assess the effectiveness of advertisements
- Compare conversion rates between the "ad" and "psa" groups
- Estimate the potential revenue generated by the ad campaign
- Use statistical and visual techniques to draw insights and make data-driven recommendations

## 📁 About the Dataset

The dataset contains records of user behavior during the marketing campaign. Below are the main features:

| Feature           | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `User ID`         | Unique identifier for each user |
| `Test Group`      | Indicates whether the user saw an ad ("ad") or PSA/nothing ("psa") |
| `Converted`       | Boolean flag showing whether the user bought the product |
| `Total Ads`       | Number of ads seen by the user |
| `Most Ads Day`    | Day of the week when the user saw the most ads |
| `Most Ads Hour`   | Hour of the day when the user saw the most ads |

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA section covers:
- Conversion rate comparison between control and experiment groups
- Distribution of total ads seen and its impact on conversion
- Time-based patterns: identifying the most effective day/hour for ad delivery
- Insights into customer behavior across test groups

---

## 📊 A/B Testing Analysis

- Conducted a hypothesis test to determine if the difference in conversion between the **ad group** and **psa group** is statistically significant
- Tested the null hypothesis: *Ad exposure does not increase the conversion rate compared to PSA exposure*
- Calculated p-values and confidence intervals to support decision-making

---

## 💰 Revenue Estimation

- Assumed a fixed product price (e.g., $100 per conversion)
- Estimated total revenue generated by users who converted in the ad group
- Compared it with the control group to measure ROI

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- SciPy (for statistical testing)  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- The **ad group** had a higher conversion rate than the **psa group**
- Statistical testing confirmed that the difference was **significant**
- Most conversions occurred during peak ad exposure times (specific days and hours)
- Estimated revenue showed a strong ROI from the campaign
